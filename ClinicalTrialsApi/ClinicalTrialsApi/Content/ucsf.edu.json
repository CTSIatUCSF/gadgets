      "description_html" : "<p>NAION is the most common cause of acute optic nerve disease in the elderly, causing permanent and severe visual loss. No proven treatment currently exists to reverse or arrest this loss. There is no accepted method for the prevention or reduction of the likelihood of second eye involvement. NAION strikes both eyes in as many as 40 percent of affected patients (Beri et al. 1987), with a 2-year risk of about 25 percent (Steven Feldon, personal communication to SEK).</p>\n\n<p>IONDT compared optic nerve decompression surgery (ONDS), which was becoming a widely used treatment for NAION, with careful followup alone, in patients with newly diagnosed NAION. The rationale for the surgery was that NAION was caused by impaired blood flow to the optic nerve and that decompression surgery would restore vision by alleviating pressure surrounding the nerve. Because ONDS was fast becoming the standard of care, evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the procedure was tested in the context of a randomized clinical trial.</p>\n\n<p>Within 2 years of the start of the IONDT, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended cessation of the clinical trial recruitment. The National Institutes of Health issued a clinical alert to 25,000 ophthalmologists and neurologists describing the study findings that surgery was no better than careful followup and may be harmful (IONDT 1995). It was recommended that ONDS not be used in cases of NAION. Thus, the IONDT findings not only have led to a costly and ineffective surgery to be abandoned as a treatment for NAION, but also have left practitioners with a dearth of treatment choices.</p>\n\n<p>The IONDT is the first multicenter, prospective study of newly diagnosed patients with NAION. The baseline history and examination, which took place within 14 days of the onset of symptoms, used standardized methods and diagnostic criteria to collect data on all factors possibly relating to the etiology of NAION. In reports from previous studies that present data on both initial and final visual acuities, no data are available regarding change in visual acuity over time for individual patients. Where data are available on final visual acuity, reported rates of improvement are low, ranging from 0 percent to 33 percent for untreated eyes. The IONDT found, however, an improvement of three or more lines in 42.7 percent of patients who received careful followup.</p>\n\n<p>NAION in both eyes has been reported in as few as 10.5 percent and as many as 73 percent of patients. In a study of bilateral NAION where all patients were prospectively logged, Beri et al. reported that 17.5 percent of patients developed bilateral disease at 1 year of followup and 34.5 percent developed it at 5 years. However, Beck et al., using a life table analysis on the same cohort reported by Beri et al., estimated the risk of bilateral NAION to be 12 percent within 2 years and 19 percent within 5 years. The IONDT has so far similarly reported a 12 percent (25/216) incidence of bilateral NAION in its randomized patients. The incidence in the nonrandomized group, 91 percent of whom had visual acuity better than 20/64, is much lower at 4 percent (5/136).</p>\n\n<p>Thus, continued followup of the IONDT cohort is critically important to ascertain a clear picture of the natural history of NAION in terms of involvement of the second eye and long-term vision. Data obtained will be critical in understanding the etiology of the disease and in generating hypotheses for testing further treatments for the disease.</p>\n\n<p>The IONDT Followup Study will continue to monitor vision and other health outcomes in patients originally enrolled in the IONDT, whether randomized to one of the two treatment groups or whether followed as part of the natural history cohort. All IONDT patients were diagnosed with NAION within 14 days of onset of symptoms, have had a minimum of 2 years of continuous followup, and will be followed for an additional 4 years in the Followup Study. Patients will have annual visits at the original IONDT Clinical Center or, if necessary, with a surrogate provider. If NAION occurs in the second eye, the patient will be asked to visit the clinic for a special visit. The Coordinating Center will telephone the patients on a quarterly basis, between annual visits. Outcomes that will be examined include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>incidence of NAION in the second eye,</li>\n<li>medical or ocular events surrounding the occurrence of NAION,</li>\n<li>visual acuity (measured using the New York Lighthouse charts).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>In the event of an NAION event in the second eye, the patient's visual field will be tested by using the Humphrey Perimeter.</p>",

      "description_html" : "<p>Infection of the eye by herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a leading cause of corneal blindness in the United States and other countries. The infection can lead to corneal scarring and neovascularization, permanent endothelial dysfunction and corneal edema, secondary glaucoma, and cataract. Despite the availability of topical antiviral agents that are highly active against HSV keratitis, there is still no known effective method for reducing the frequency of recurrence or severity of stromal keratitis and iridocyclitis. In addition, the prognosis is poor for recovery of good vision following penetrating keratoplasty for actively inflamed or highly vascularized herpetic corneas.</p>\n\n<p>On the basis of both animal and human studies, the antiviral agent acyclovir may both treat and prevent recurrence of HSV disease. However, no consensus yet exists on the use of acyclovir in the management and prevention of herpetic eye disease.</p>\n\n<p>HEDS-II consists of two randomized, placebo-controlled trials that are assessing the role of oral acyclovir in the management of herpetic eye disease and one epidemiologic study that is investigating risk factors, including stress, for the development of ocular recurrences of the disease. The organizational structure consists of a national coordinating center, eight regional coordinating clinical centers, and approximately 60 clinical sites. The clinical sites where patients are enrolled and followed include both university-based and community-based practices.</p>\n\n<p>Herpes Simplex Virus Epithelial Keratitis Trial: HEDS-EKT evaluated the benefit of oral acyclovir given during treatment of an acute HSV keratitis (dendritic or geographic keratitis) in preventing the occurrence of later blinding complications. Patients entered the trial within 7 days of onset. All patients received standard treatment with a topical antiviral and were randomized to receive either oral acyclovir (400 mg five times a day for 21 days) or a placebo. Patients had eight visits within a 12-month followup period. The primary outcome was the time to the first occurrence of stromal keratitis or iridocyclitis in the study eye (eye with epithelial keratitis at time of study entry). The HEDS-EKT recruitment goal was 502 patients.</p>\n\n<p>Acyclovir Prevention Trial: HEDS-APT evaluated the benefit of long-term acyclovir treatment in patients with a recent history of HSV eye disease but no current active disease. To be eligible, a patient must have experienced any kind of ocular herpes simplex infection (blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, or iridocyclitis) in the preceding year. The infection must have been inactive and untreated for at least the previous 30 days. Patients were randomized to receive either oral acyclovir (400 mg twice a day) or placebo for 1 year. Five followup visits occurred during the 1-year treatment period and an additional three followup visits during the 6-month post-treatment period. Episodes of recurrent HSV eye disease during the trial were treated with topical corticosteroids and antivirals as indicated, but patients continued to receive the oral acyclovir or placebo for the entire 365-day period. The primary outcome was the time to the first recurrence of any type of HSV eye disease in either eye. The recruitment goal was 696 patients.</p>\n\n<p>Ocular HSV Recurrence Factor Study: HEDS-RFS is evaluating the effect of psychological, environmental, and biological factors on recurrences of herpetic eye disease. Patients recruited into the HEDS-APT trial are eligible to participate in HEDS-RFS if they are 18 years or older. At entry, all subjects fill out a questionnaire to estimate the negative affectivity trait measure. Subjects also fill out a short questionnaire every week for 52 weeks to track acute and chronic stressors (e.g., illnesses, injuries, menstrual periods, sun exposure, emotional and financial stresses). The investigators ensure patient privacy by the patient's mailing of the weekly logs directly to the HEDS National Coordinating Center.</p>",

Untreated CMV (cytomegalovirus) retinitis is a progressive disorder, the end result of which is total retinal destruction and blindness. As of September 1997, drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CMV (cytomegalovirus)retinitis were ganciclovir (Cytovene), foscarnet (Foscavir), and cidofovir (Vistide). Cidofovir has a prolonged duration of effect permitting intermittent administration. All systemically administered anti-CMV drugs are given in a similar fashion consisting of initial 2-week high-dose treatment (induction) to control the infection followed by long-term lower dose treatment (maintenance) to prevent relapse. Cidofovir is administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for induction therapy and once every 2 weeks as maintenance therapy. The HPCRT evaluated the efficacy and safety of cidofovir therapy.</p>\n\n<p>The HPCRT was a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial of cidofovir for the treatment of CMV (cytomegalovirus) retinitis. Patients with small peripheral CMV (cytomegalovirus) retinitis lesions (i.e., not at risk of immediate loss of visual acuity) were randomized to immediate treatment with cidofovir or deferred therapy until the retinitis had progressed. Patients randomized to immediate therapy received either 1) low-dose cidofovir at 5 mg/kg once weekly induction for 2 weeks, followed by 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for maintenance or 2) high-dose cidofovir at 5 mg/kg once weekly induction for 2 weeks followed by 5 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for maintenance. Patients whose retinitis progressed were given treatment according to best medical judgement, and those assigned to deferral were generally treated with cidofovir.</p>\n\n<p>Outcomes in this trial included retinitis progression, loss of retinal area, and morbidity.</p>",

      "description_html" : "<p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is among the most frequently encountered opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS. In the era of prophylaxis for pneumocystic pneumonia, CMV disease is estimated to affect 45 percent of patients with AIDS sometime between the diagnosis of AIDS and death. Retinitis has been estimated to account for up to 85 percent of CMV disease in these patients, making CMV retinitis the most common ocular infection encountered. CMV retinitis is a relatively late-stage manifestation, associated with cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) + T-cell counts &lt; 100 cells/µL and often &lt; 50 cells/µL.</p>\n\n<p>All currently available treatments for CMV suppress viral replication but do not eliminate the virus from the body. Discontinuation of therapy is associated with a prompt relapse of the retinitis. Despite the use of chronic suppressive therapy, relapse of the retinitis generally occurs, at least with systemically administered anti-CMV drugs.</p>\n\n<p>The first two treatments approved for CMV retinitis were intravenous ganciclovir and intravenous foscarnet. Both are given by daily intravenous infusions and therefore require central venous catheters. The development of newer treatments has focused not only on efficacious treatments, but also on treatments that do not require central venous catheters. Available treatments now include oral ganciclovir, the ganciclovir intraocular device, and intravenous cidofovir.</p>\n\n<p>In vitro data suggest that combination therapies are synergistic in inhibiting viral replication; these therapies include a foscarnet-ganciclovir combination and a cidofovir-ganciclovir combination. In the SOCA--CMV Retinitis Retreatment Trial, the combination of intravenous ganciclovir and foscarnet was more effective than either drug alone for the treatment of relapsed retinitis. Therefore, the combination of intermittent intravenous cidofovir and daily oral ganciclovir may be an attractive therapy for relapsed disease because it may provide synergy for controlling both ocular and visceral disease while not necessitating either a central venous catheter or an intraocular surgical procedure.</p>\n\n<p>The Ganciclovir-Cidofovir CMV Retinitis Trial (GCCRT) is a randomized, multicenter clinical trial. Patients will be assigned to receive one of two regimens: (1) ganciclovir intraocular device plus oral ganciclovir or (2) intravenous cidofovir. The intraocular device will be surgically implanted at baseline and again every 6 to 8 months in eyes with CMV retinitis. Oral ganciclovir is taken at a dose of 1 gram three times daily. Cidofovir will be administered intravenously at 5 mg/kg once weekly for 2 consecutive weeks and once every 2 weeks thereafter. If disease progression occurs in patients receiving cidofovir, patients will be given reinduction therapy, and oral ganciclovir at a dose of 1 gram three times per day will be added to the treatment. If patients assigned to cidofovir are unable to tolerate that regimen, an alternative systemic regimen will be recommended.</p>\n\n<p>Study outcome variables include a decrease of three or more lines from baseline in best corrected visual acuity and rate of visual field loss. The study will also assess other variables including mortality, blood CMV and HIV load, quality of life, and medical costs.</p>\n\n<p>Treatment assignment will not be masked to either patients or clinicians; however, reading of fundus photographs to determine both change in retinal involvement and progression will be masked.</p>",

The most common finding is a non-infectious \"HIV retinopathy\", characterized by cotton wool spots, intraretinal hemorrhages, and/or microaneurysms. These changes occur in approximately 50 percent of patients with AIDS. HIV retinopathy alone is not typically associated with clinical loss of vision, but functional deficits in patients with AIDS without other ocular complications may be due to this phenomenon.</p>\n\n<p>CMV retinitis has had the most clinical importance of all the associated complications of AIDS. It is commonly seen in late stage AIDS, and even when treated has the potential to cause substantial loss of vision. CMV retinitis is also the most costly AIDS-related opportunistic infection; the mean monthly cost of treatment has been estimated at $7,825. The incidence of CMV retinitis has varied with changes in the therapeutic and prophylactic strategies for AIDS and its complications. It has been on the decline in recent years related to the increased use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART).</p>\n\n<p>Other ocular complications of AIDS such as ocular toxoplasmosis, herpes zoster retinitis, and pneumocystis choroidopathy occur less frequently than CMV retinitis and HIV retinopathy. Their frequency has also changed over the course of the AIDS epidemic.</p>\n\n<p>Because the epidemiology of AIDS is rapidly evolving, with HIV becoming more like a chronic disease, new information is needed on the incidence and course of ocular complications. We have little information about the effect of HAART therapy over time on changes in immune status and the risk of ocular complications of AIDS. More information is also needed to determine who is at risk for developing ocular complications of AIDS, and how treatment is affecting their visual function, quality of life, and survival.</p>\n\n<p>The Longitudinal Study of Ocular Complications of AIDS (LSOCA) is prospective observational study of patients with AIDS. Patients with a prior diagnosis of AIDS according to the 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria with or without ocular complications will be enrolled over a 4 year period. Approximately 2,000 patients will be enrolled in the study. Enrollment of patients with CMV retinitis at baseline will be between 300 and 600 patients. Followup visits for patients without ocular complications will be scheduled every 6 months. Followup visits for patients with ocular complications at baseline or diagnosed during followup will be every 3 months. Followup data will include eye examinations, fundus photographs, visual function testing, medical history, hematology and serum chemistry, and collection of plasma and blood cells for banking. Analysis of banked specimens will include HIV RNA levels and CMV DNA levels.</p>",

      "description_html" : "<p>This clinical trial will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel-group study of vitamin E and donepezil in 720 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment groups (240 subjects per treatment group): 1) Placebo vitamin E and placebo donepezil plus a multivitamin daily. 2) Vitamin E (2,000 I) and placebo donepezil plus a multivitamin daily.3) Donepezil (10 mg) and placebo vitamin E plus a multivitamin daily.</p>\n\n<p>The study will be conducted over three years, with clinical evaluations every 3 months for the first 6 months and then every 6 months. Subjects randomized to donepezil will start a dose of 5 mg daily. Donepezil will be increased to 10 mg after six weeks. Subjects randomized to vitamin E will start at 1,000 I daily. The dose of Vitamin E will be increased to 2,000 I after six weeks. There will be a 12-month recruitment period. The primary endpoint will be time to development of Probable or Possible AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Upon determination of a clinical diagnosis of AD, documentation will be sent to the ADCS Coordinating Center and forwarded to the Central Review Committee for verification. Upon verification, of conversion to diagnosis of AD, subjects will stop taking the donepezil study medication or its corresponding placebo, without breaking the blind, and will be offered open label donepezil at a scheduled visit one month after the prior diagnostic visit. Donepezil will be offered to subjects who convert to AD until the subject completes three years from the baseline visit. Based on an estimated incidence of AD of 15% per year, the study has 85% power to detect a 33% or greater reduction in conversion to AD over 3 years. Secondary outcome measures will include change on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-COG), the Neuropsychological Battery, the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), ADCS- Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL), a Pharmacoeconomics scale, and a Quality of Life scale. Compliance will be monitored through the measurement of alpha-tocopherol levels and pill counts at each visit.</p>",

An NIA-funded study recently confirmed that MCI is different from both dementia and normal age-related changes in memory. Accurate and early evaluation and treatment of MCI individuals might prevent further cognitive decline, including development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Memory Impairment Study is the first such AD prevention clinical trial carried out by NIH, and will be conducted at 65-80 medical research institutions located in the United States and Canada. This study will test the usefulness of two drugs to slow or stop the conversion from MCI to AD. The trial will evaluate placebo, vitamin E, and donepezil, an investigational agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration for another use. Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is thought to have antioxidant properties, and was shown in a 1997 study to delay important dementia milestones, such as patients' institutionalization or progression to severe dementia, by about seven months.",

      "description_html" : "<p>Low back pain is considered one of the most widely experienced health problems in the U.S. and the world. It is the second most frequent condition, after the common cold, for which patients see a physician or lose days from work. Estimated costs to those who are severely disabled from low back pain range from $30-70 billion annually. Rates of spinal surgery in the U.S. have increased sharply over time, and researchers have documented 15-fold geographic variation in rates of these surgeries. In many cases, where one lives and who one sees for the condition appear to determine the rates of surgery. Despite these trends, there is little evidence proving the effectiveness of these therapies over nonsurgical management.</p>\n\n<p>This study will use the National Spine Network to conduct a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for the three most common diagnostic groups for which spine surgery is performed: lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IDH), spinal stenosis (SpS), and spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS). This arm of the trial will deal with patients from the third diagnostic group. The study will compare the most commonly used standard surgical treatments to the most commonly used standard nonsurgical treatments. We will conduct the study at 12 sites throughout the United States.</p>\n\n<p>The primary endpoint of the study will be changes in health-related quality of life as measured by the SF-36 health status questionnaire. Secondary endpoints will include patient satisfaction with treatment, utility for current health in order to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYS) as the measure for cost-effectiveness, resource use, and cost.</p>\n\n<p>We will follow patients at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to determine their health status, function, satisfaction, and health care use. We anticipate that we will enroll and randomly allocate a total of 300 study participants in this arm of the trial. We will track an additional observational cohort to assess health and resource outcomes. Enrollment in the Observational cohort has been completed as of February 2003.</p>\n\n<p>We will integrate data from the trial and observational cohorts to formally estimate the cost-effectiveness of surgical versus nonsurgical interventions for IDH, SpS, and DS. The results of this trial will provide, for the first time, scientific evidence as to the relative effectiveness of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for these three most commonly diagnosed lumbar spine conditions.</p>",

      "description_html" : "<p>Low back pain is considered one of the most widely experienced health problems in the United States and the world. This condition is the second most frequent condition, after the common cold, for which people see a physician or lose days from work. Estimated costs to those who are severely disabled from low back pain range from $30-70 billion annually. Rates of spinal surgery in the U.S. have increased sharply over time, and researchers have documented 15-fold geographic variation in rates of these surgeries. In many cases, where one lives and who one sees for the problem appear to determine the rates of surgery. Despite these trends, there is little evidence proving the effectiveness of these therapies over non-surgical management.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the SPORT study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for the three most common diagnostic groups for which spine surgery is performed: lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IDH), spinal stenosis (SpS) and spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS). This arm of the trial will deal with patients from the first diagnostic group. The study will compare the most commonly used standard surgical treatments to the most commonly used standard non-surgical treatments. We will conduct the study at 12 sites throughout the United States.</p>\n\n<p>The primary endpoint of the study will be changes in health-related quality of life as measured by the SF-36 health status questionnaire. Secondary endpoints will include patient satisfaction with treatment, utility for current health in order to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYS) as the measure for cost-effectiveness, resource use, and cost.</p>\n\n<p>We will follow patients at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to determine their health status, function, satisfaction, and use of health care. In this arm of the trial, we anticipate enrolling and randomly allocating a total of 500 participants. We will track an additional observational cohort to assess health and resource outcomes (1000 participants). Enrollment in the Observational cohort has been completed as of February 2003.</p>\n\n<p>We will integrate data from the trial and observational cohorts to formally estimate the cost-effectiveness of surgical versus non-surgical interventions for IDH, SpS, and DS. On the basis of the results of this trial we will, for the first time, have scientific evidence as to the relative effectiveness of surgical versus non-surgical treatment for these three most commonly diagnosed lumbar spine conditions.</p>",
