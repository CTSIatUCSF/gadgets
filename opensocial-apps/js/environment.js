var ENV_MENTOR_EXAMPLES = "EXAMPLE 1:<br />Dr. Brown is willing to mentor faculty, fellows, have "
  + "residents and students interested in an academic research career.  Most often her mentees "
  + "had training in clinical research methods or will obtain training through the CTSI CTST. For "
  + "students, it is expected they will have dedicated time for research. Through email or meeting, "
  + "if there is a &quot;match&quot; for research interest, time, and training, further discussions "
  + "as to project, goals, and access to resources (space, databases, and  statistical support) "
  + "will be discussed to provide a productive experience.<br><br>EXAMPLE 2:<br />"
  + "I am highly qualified to participate as a lead mentor or co-mentor at UCSF. My program of "
  + "research is focused on health outcomes associated with disturbed sleep in various populations "
  + "of healthy women and women with chronic illnesses like HIV/AIDS and cancer.  I have completed "
  + "cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies, and most recently, randomized clinical trials "
  + "to improve sleep.  I have mentored doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows studying various "
  + "patient populations, from the very young to very old.  During my tenure at UCSF, I have directly "
  + "supervised over 30 doctoral students, mentored 14 postdoctoral trainees, and served as a lead "
  + "mentor for 6 pre-tenured faculty. I have been the Director for a T32 Nurse Research Training "
  + "Grant since 1996, and I have been honored with being voted mentor of the year by doctoral "
  + "students on two occasions.  I play a significant role in the clinical and translational (CTSI) "
  + "research mentoring and career development programs at UCSF.  I am the seminar leader for the first "
  + "session in the CTSI Mentor Development program on &quot;Rewards and Challenges of Mentoring&quot; "
  + "and I have co-mentored two KL2 scholars.  I have published over 50 peer-reviewed research "
  + "articles with trainees as first-author, and serve as a consultant on two external K awards as "
  + "well as three external R01 awards with former mentees. Finally, I have served on many different "
  + "NIH study section review panels, and I served as the Chair of an NIH study section (2008-2010),"
  + "which allows me to be particularly effective in mentoring early career principal investigators "
  + "who are writing their first NIH applications.<br><br>"
  + "I can provide mentees a cubicle space with my research team, tangible resources such as access "
  + "to large datasets for secondary analysis as needed, and intangible resources such as attending "
  + "our formal research team meetings and our informal spontaneous group discussions as well as "
  + "networking at national sleep research conferences.";
